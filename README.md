### S3 Buckets

*S3 Buckets are a storage service provided by Amazon AWS, allowing people to save files and even static website content in the cloud accessible over HTTP and HTTPS. Sometimes these access permissions are incorrectly set and inadvertently allow access to files that shouldn't be available to the public.*

S3 Buckets link format: `http(s)://{name}.s3.amazonaws.com` where `{name}` is set by the owner. Common names used are `{name}-assets`, `{name}-www`, `{name}-public`, `{name}-private`, etc.
